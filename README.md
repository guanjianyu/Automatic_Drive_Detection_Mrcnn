# Automatic_Drive_Detection_Tensorflow_Convnet

This is an implemention of [Tensorflow detection model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md) on Python 3 and TensorFlow. The project adopts four different models in Model Zoo to detect cars on road in demo video.
